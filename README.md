This is a place to practice git. Your first exercise is to add your name to this list.

- **Learn to use git**:
  - Go through the try git tutorial at https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
  - Read the first two chapters of the book [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

  To do so first go through the [curated list of git resource](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/) provided by github and learn to use git.

- **Fork the respository, create a new branch, make changes and send a pull request**
  - [This article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) should give you a good idea of what pull requests are, and how to use them.


Your entry should maintain the alphabetic order and it should be in the format:

`* your name [username](http://github.com/username)`.

This file is written in the [Markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Lines starting with `*` are automatically rendered as bullet points and phrases containing `[name](URL)` are automatically hyperlinked.
